# Face Recognition Project 👤👥

## Description 

The Face Recognition Project is a Python-based application that utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize and identify faces in images or video streams. It employs deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract facial features and classify individuals based on these features. The project supports multiclassification, allowing for the identification of multiple individuals from a given set of people.

## Features 🚀

- Detect and recognize faces in images or video streams.
- Multiclassification for identifying multiple individuals.
- Trainable models to adapt to specific datasets.
- Integration with webcam for real-time face recognition.
